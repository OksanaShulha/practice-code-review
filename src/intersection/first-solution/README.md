**Returns**: <code>Array</code> - Returns the new array of filtered values.

## Strategy

Use a built-in array and object methods to solve this challenge, because once you know them they are easy to read and save a lot of lines and time.

---

## Implementation

Is used an `if` and `else` statement:

1. The `if` statement reflects that if the argument is non an array throws an error.
2. The `else` if is an array, I will follow the next steps:

- Use the `filter()` method to have a new array with only the elements that match.
- Use the constructor `Set()` to store only unique values of the array, _the result will be an object_.
- use the spread operator in brackets to convert the object in an array

There was a tricky thing I had to figure out:

Is that the return value of the Set constructor in an object, and using it with the spread operator inside of brackets converts the object in to an array ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set))

## Use Cases

Create an array showing a list of students that are in two groups

```js
const group1 = {
  student1: "Oksana Shulha",
  student2: "Mayuri Patil",
  student3: "Erkam Guresen",
  student4: "Emely Salmeron",
  student5: "Rafael Garcia",
};

const group2 = {
  student1: "Evan cole",
  student2: "Furkan Kilic",
  student3: "Inggrite Novaleta",
  student4: "Emely Salmeron",
  student5: "Rafael Garcia",
};

console.log(arrayIntersection(Object.values(group1), Object.values(group2))); //=> ["Emely Salmeron", "Rafael Garcia"]
```
